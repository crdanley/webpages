    <p>Hi my name is Christopher, but people call me Reid. I like music alot and listen to alot of diffrent stuff. Another fun fact is that today (Feb 12th) is my birthday. 
    For my birthday I got a turn table to play records on. I am very excited to explore the world of secondhand records, sterios and all of the fun that comes with it.</p>
